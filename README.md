      <td valign="text-top">GalaxPong is a two-player game that simulates a virtual galaxy table tennis match. The gameplay is incredibly straightforward. Two paddles, represented as vertical lines or bars, are placed on opposite sides of the screen. A ball, typically a small square or circle, bounces back and forth between the two paddles. The objective of each player is to prevent the ball from passing their paddle and to bounce it back towards their opponent. The player who misses the ball and allows it to pass their paddle concedes a point to their opponent.</td>
      <td valign="text-top">A 2D platformer is a style of video game where players control a character that can walk between horizontal and vertical platforms in a two-dimensional world. In order to complete a level or stage, the main goal in these games is to jump, run, and interact with numerous obstacles, monsters, or puzzles.<div></div></td>
